# hello-world
This is a place where I store ideas, resources, or even share and discuss things with others.
I am working through a Python course on Coursera. I took a few courses in Python several years ago, but I have forgotten most of what I learned. I hope there are still enough memory traces in my brain so that I can relearn rather quickly.
